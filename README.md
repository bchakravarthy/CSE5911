Landlord Mobile will be an iOS app for property owners which will include a set of Alexa Skills. Alexa will provide voice-based analytical abilities for accessing data in the cloud. The iPhone interface will provide a mechanism for accessing and updating data for property owners such as data models like expense types, mortgage loan details, and rental agreements. 

This app was originally implemented as a website using PHP and the team will convert it into an iOS app so that more users will be able to use their phones to quickly browse through and make quick updates and gather important information. This will attract more users as speed and efficiency is highly sought after.
